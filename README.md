simple react-native app for a daily todo list

it's very minimal so it won't require much system resources
(no internet connection used)

Levels, progress, and next level are saved in storage.
Current task status is not saved in this version.

you can run it through expo for now: https://expo.io/@cpye/daily-todo-list

I have tested it natively on my phone (android) and it works there, but I want to add
a few new features and more testing before I submit it to an app store.
